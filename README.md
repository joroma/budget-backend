Welcome, you magnificent human.

This is the backend API for a **budgeting app** based on the **Envelope Budgeting System** — a dead-simple but insanely powerful way to stop letting your money boss you around.

## 🧠 WTF is Envelope Budgeting?

Imagine your paycheck arrives. Instead of throwing it all into one big pile and hoping you don’t blow it all at Taco Bell, you split it into **envelopes**: rent, groceries, coffee, "treat yourself," whatever.  
Each envelope gets a job. Every dollar has a purpose. You’re the boss. 💪

In the old days, people used *actual* paper envelopes (wild, right?). Now we’re doing the same idea, just... less papery and more app-y.

Some cool reads if you wanna nerd out:

- [The Balance - Envelope System Overview](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/envelope-budgeting-system-1289587)

## 📦 What the API Handles

Our API keeps track of three main things:

### Accounts

Think checking account, savings account, credit card, jar full of spare change — whatever holds your cash.  
Accounts are the big buckets where your money actually lives before you tell it where to go.

### Categories

These are your *envelopes*.  
Examples:
- Rent
- Groceries
- Drunk Amazon Purchases
- Emergency Vet Visits
- That One Subscription You Keep Forgetting to Cancel

You assign money to these bad boys to keep your spending honest.

### Transactions

When money moves (in or out), that's a transaction.  
Bought groceries? Transaction. Got paid? Transaction.  
Everything’s tracked so you can *actually* know where your money’s going instead of wondering why you’re broke on the 12th of the month.

## 🤔 Why Bother?

Because guessing at your finances sucks.  
Because stressing over bills is even worse.  
Because Future You deserves better than digging through couch cushions for bus fare.

This system helps you:
- Spend without guilt
- Save without confusion
- Tell your money to sit the fuck down and behave
